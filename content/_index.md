Welcome to the official **Zero Trust Auth\*** (`ZTAuth*`) specification.

**ZTAuth\*** *ensures secure, identity-based execution of actions on resources by enforcing least privilege at the application boundary. Built for eventual consistency, the security model is incrementally synchronized across applicative nodes in an immutable, versioned manner*.

Made for real-world problems. Shaped by people who build real-world systems. Welcome to `ZTAuth*`.
