title: Zero Trust Auth*
---
Welcome to the official **Zero Trust Auth\*** (`ZTAuth*`) open protocol specification.

> **ZTAuth\*** is a Zero Trust-compliant security protocol that enforces identity-based, least-privilege access at the application edge. Built for distributed environments, it ensures integrity through a tamper-proof, versioned, model compliant security model that stays consistent across nodes, even under disconnection.

**Zero Trust Auth\*** blends "Zero Trust" rigor with `Auth*`—covering authentication (AuthN), authorization (AuthZ), and more, like trusted elevation and delegation.

Pronounce it `Zee-Tee-Auth-Star`. The `star` is a wildcard, hinting at extras like `trusted elevation` or `delegation`.

For short, use `ZTAStar` (`Zee-Tee-Ei-Star`). It’s snappy, keeps the vibe, and might just stick as the go-to name.
