`ZTAuth*` implements `Auth*` and `Trusted` models that are designed to be immutable, versionable, and transferable. For certain targets, such as instances of thin clients (e.g., web applications or hardware), itâ€™s not feasible to port the entire model history.

In this context, `Portable Models` come into play. The idea is to extract the latest snapshot of those models, which must also be signed as a certification, and transfer it to the target.

For example:

- A browser could request a portable model to enforce client-side security first.
- A blockchain could receive a portable model from an oracle, which is fed with the portable model.
